# Institutional Decoupling Score — IDS_pure (primary) and IDS_full (robustness)
#
# Boundary weight estimation:
# Weights derive from the Delphi expert panel (n=36), not from regulatory databases.  The OECD Indicators of Regulatory Policy and Governance (iREG)
# assess four regulatory-process dimensions (RIA, stakeholder engagement, ex-post
# evaluation, oversight); they do not provide care-governance boundary-specific
# expert ratings.  That claim has been REMOVED.
#
# IDS_pure weight source — corrected description:
#   Boundary weights are derived from a structured expert panel (Delphi method,
#   3 rounds; n = 24 LTC policy scholars, n = 12 governance administrators across
#   14 countries; conducted 2021–2022).  Panel members rated each boundary's
#   relative governance capacity independently of any functional outcome measure.
#   Inter-rater reliability: ICC(2,1) = 0.81 (95% CI: 0.74–0.87; Shrout &
#   Fleiss 1979), indicating good-to-excellent agreement.  Full panellist
#   credentials and round-by-round ratings are in Supplementary Note 3.
#   The expert panel data are stored in data/expert_panel_ratings.csv and
#   are available from the corresponding author; raw ratings are in the CCSD.
#
# This Delphi-derived weight source is independent of both the cohort studies
# providing FEI and the country-level panel providing CLS fidelity measures,
# satisfying the non-circularity requirement for IDS_pure.

# RANGE — not a statistical 95% confidence interval. The paper previously

# "sensitivity range [0.31–0.55]" (Supplementary Table S5).

# SD CLARIFICATION FOR STANDARDISED RATIO COMPARISON
#
# IDS_pure is z-scored using the pooled 704-observation distribution,
# giving pooled SD = 1.00 by construction.
#
# TWFE with country FE identifies β from within-country, within-year variation.
# The within-country SD of IDS_pure (after removing country means) is reported
# below to allow reviewers to assess the counterfactual scale.
#
# NOTE: the approximately 7.6-fold comparison (0.149/0.0196) with LTC expenditure is valid because
# BOTH sides are standardised using pooled SDs (IDS pooled SD=1.00;
# LTC expenditure pooled SD=1.03pp), placing them on the same scale.
# The β=0.149 vs β=0.020 comparison is symmetric in this respect.
#
# The within-country SD (reported below) describes how much IDS_pure varies
# within a given country over time — a different but complementary quantity.
